For the programs the hierarchy should be as follows: 


PROGRAM --> DAY(S) --> WORKOUT(S) --> EXERCISE(S)

^each of these is a one to many 

for example: 

program "deload week" could have 3 days 

  day 1: 
    workouts: 
      lift 1: 
        exercises = [...]
      throw 1: 
        exercises = [...]

  day 2: 
    workout: 
      lift 2: 
        exercises = [...]
      throw 2: 
        exercises = [...]

  day 2: 
    workout: 
      lift 3: 
        exercises = [...]
      throw 1: 
        exercises = [...]


- these programs should be able to be assigned to users
^^ handle this later



FLOW: 

1. 'new program' 
2. how many days? -- optionally assign to calendar dates 
3. edit each day 
    - can choose from existing workout or create new one (can have multiple workouts on one day)
    - if you choose from existing workout you should be able to slightly modify it 

--> each program can have its own workouts. we would call them something like 
<name_of_program>-<name_of_workout> 
deload_3-day_1
